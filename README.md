## Synopsis

Given a two-dimensional array which visualize a map. 
Each element of this array will take one of the following values:
* 0 (which represents water),
* 1 (which represents land).

 These values will form islands on water.

For example:

`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\
`0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\
`1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0`\
`1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0`\
`0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0`\
`0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`\
`1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\
`0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0`

(This example illustrates 4 islands. Counting from the left upper corner: First Island is made of six land elements, Second Island is also made of six land elements. The third island consists of 3 elements, and the last one is made of two elements).

* Java 8
* Gradle
* JUnit 4.12+
